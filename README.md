<pre>      In the preceding chapter, we have calculated the chances of an event, knowing the circumstances </br>under which it is to happen or fail. We are now to place ourselves in an inverted position: we know the event,</br>and ask what is the probability which results from the event in favour of of any set of circumstances under </br>which the same might have happened.

### What _was_ not clear about this term in the past?
The inventors of the term seemed to not notice the subtle difference between the probability of a real event and the "probability of a probability of event having some particular value". The tautologically equivalent word 'likelihood' doesn't clarify the situation, it makes it even more vague and obscure.

### What do we do about this confusion?
Eigther we continue using this word 'Bayesian' all the time until the end of days or... Let's introduce an operator with a simple and obvious name 'inversion'. If you apply this operator to a probability distribution __function__ of some data you get an inverse probability distribution __function__. In the same way as you calculate an inverse function from a function by applying the inversion operator /sup(-1).
