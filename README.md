<pre>      In the preceding chapter, we have calculated the chances of an event, knowing the circumstances </br>under which it is to happen or fail. We are now to place ourselves in an inverted position: we know the event,</br>and ask what is the probability which results from the event in favour of of any set of circumstances under </br>which the same might have happened.
